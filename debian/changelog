  * Changed how ACKs are handled. They are now handled through callback functions and are included in the CallbackHandlers.
  * Added UPD messages.
  * Added Cfg NMEA messages for firmware 6 & 7, since the messages are a different length
  * Added the CfgDAT message with custom serialization for get/set (read/write) since the messages are different lengths

ros-foxy-ublox-msgs (1.1.0-1focal) focal; urgency=high

  * Updated package xmls with new version number and corrected my email address. Also updated readme to include information about new version plus new parameter
  * changed name of macro for clarity
  * Added Cfg RST message declaration and reset function. For Firmware 8, after reconfiguring the GNSS, a cold restart is initiated.
  * node now configures INF messages
  * added CfgINF message
  * added comment about deprecated setting
  * Added NavPVT7 message since NavPVT message is a different length for firmware version 7. UbloxFirmware7Plus class now uses a template function to update diagnostics from NavPVT messages and to publish fix messages from NavPVT messages.
  * Added NavATT message
  * Added message declarations for newly included messages as well as serialization classes for messages with repeating blocks.
  * Added all ESF messages. Added HNR cfg message and HNR PVT message. Added MGA GAL message.
  * added constants for SBAS reserved and max tracking channels
  * comments cleanup
  * Added additional MON messages. Received INF messages are now printed to the ROS console. Also added constants and comments to serialization and a new macro so 1 message can have multiple class, message ID pairs.
  * Added NavSAT message and moved subscribers for messages deprecated in version 8 to version specific subscribe methods
  * Added Error message for ASIO read read errors and fixed a comment in cfg rate
  * Includes BUG FIX (keep reading). Added Ublox messages (and subscribers or configuration methods + params) for High Precision GNSS devices: CfgDGNSS, NavRELPOSNED, NavSVIN. Also added subscriber & message for RxmRTCM. Changed MonVER processing, it now determines the protocol version, hardware type (e.g. SPG/HPG), and supported GNSS (e.g. Glonass, SBAS). SBAS can now be disabled on SBAS supported devices (previously SBAS settings were ignored if enable_sbas was false to prevent crashes, now it checks the MonVER message before trying to configure SBAS.
  * Added CfgTMODE3 message for High Precision GNSS products
